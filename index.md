# Self Assessment

Throughout my time spent in the Computer Science Program at Southern New Hampshire University I have been exposed to and built experience with many different tech stacks. I improved my coding skills in several languags while also deepening my understanding of softwae design, implementations, testing, and collaborative development. With the experience earned throughout this program and the formation of this ePortfolio, I was able to showcase my use of program languages in the forms of C++, Java, HTML, Python and SQL. 

In regards to collaborating in a team environment, I learned the importance of communication in the CS-310 Collaboration and team project course. The whole clas learned about git together and we all contributed to the same repository to simulate the way professional software develooment teams all work together. Collaboration between team members is crucial to the successful development of a project and it's important to follow best practices when working with continuous development projects. This practice saves money and time for a team and keeps projects on a proper timetable. This is where you can keep stakeholders happy as computer science is a business at the end of the day. You can think of stakeholders like investors and clients who fund the projects and work of computer science employees. Keeping them happy and secure is important so implementing these techniques is important to keep projects on time and budget. 

Data structures and algorithms, software engineering, database are highlighted in the artifacts presented in this ePortfolio. Understanding the data structure was a key point in my learning and the algortithms used to manipulate them. As for software engineering, this is about the overall process of developing projects from front to back. The software devlopment life cylce and the ability to connext different parts of a program were an ever present aspect of courses in the program. When it comes to databases, I learned quickly how to use SQl command to issue quearies and manipulate database data. From there si was a simple transition to include sql databases in bigger projects. 

Security is another important topic. With so much data passing through the internet it is the responsibility of every software engineer to protect the end user byt designing and devoloping code that is safe and effective. Security risk has to always be taken into account. For every project security measures have been to be made to avoid the loss of time, money, or resources.

This ePortfolio has three artifacts that represent the three foundations of computer science. Alongside these three artifacts will be a code review video on each artifact. Each artifact is then enhanced in some way.

### [Data Structures and Algorithms](algorithms_data_structures.md)
This artifact is series of small programs used to showcase the benefits and efficiency of different data structures and search algorithms which were built during the Data Structures and Algorithms class in the program. It showcases my skills both for using a low level programming language to create a data structure and to utilize these structure with various tree traversal methods.

### [Software Engineering and Design](software_design_engineering.md)
This artifact is a full stack application for an animal shelter using Jupyter, Python, and MongoDB which was built in Client Server Development class during program. It showcases my skills both for front and back-end development as well as how to connect the two using a python module. 

### [Databases](databases.md)
This artifact is weight loss written in java using the android studio development environment during the Mobile Architecture and Programming class in the program. It showcases my skills In using Android studio to design and implement the layers of an mobile application. This program includes a front end for the user to interact with, the backend database to store user data, and the driver in between.
