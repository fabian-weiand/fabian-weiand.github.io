Project 1

Software Design and Engineering

This artifact is a full stack application for an animal shelter using Jupyter, Python, and MongoDB which was built in Client Server Development class during program. 
It showcases my skills both for front and back-end development as well as how to connect the two using a python module. 

The improvements I made were firstly to clean up the code. There were several lines of code and comments that I used during development to test the code and as reminders for myself. These were simply removed. Next, I went through to provide clear annotations for each code block to describe its purpose. The next step was to add a readme file to include the process for setting up the MongoDB backend. Lastly, I included a requirements file to include all the python module dependencies for easy environment set-up
The enhancements evolved a little after the initial proposal in Module one. The code review helped highlight several areas for improvement I had not initially thought about. Additionally, some of the outcomes I had considered for enhancements did not get included. It was a matter of deciding if the investment was worth the outcome and while adapting the code to run on a browser would have been a nice addition the time consumption would have been too great to make it worth it for this artifact.
The biggest challenge I ran into during the enhancement was that the program was initially designed using the virtual platform that SNHU offers. Changing the environment required several adjustments to my program and I needed to spend a good amount of time figuring out how to set up a virtual environment that included all the necessary dependencies. However, this same challenge helped to break through what had been a sticking point for me in past projects so a really worthwhile obstacle to overcome!
